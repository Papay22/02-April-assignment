    " Search CV (Cross-Validation) is a technique used in machine learning to find the best hyperparameters for a given model. Hyperparameters are the parameters that are not learned by the model during training, but rather set by the user before training. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, regularization strength, and number of hidden layers in a neural network.\n",

    "The purpose of Grid Search CV is to systematically search through a range of hyperparameters and find the combination that results in the best performance of the model on a validation set. It works by creating a grid of all possible combinations of hyperparameters and evaluating each combination using cross-validation. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times and evaluating the performance of the model on each split.\n",

    "Data leakage is a problem in machine learning where information from the training data is inadvertently included in the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates and poor generalization to new data.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Target leakage: when the target variable (the variable we are trying to predict) is influenced by variables that would not be available in a real-world scenario. For example, if we are trying to predict whether a customer will default on a loan, and we include the customer's credit score in the training data, this would be target leakage because the credit score is influenced by whether the customer has defaulted on loans in the past.\n",
    "Train-test contamination: when information from the test set (the set of data used to evaluate the model's performance) is inadvertently included in the training data. For example, if we use the test set to select features or tune hyperparameters, this would be train-test contamination because the model has \"seen\" information from the test set before.\n",

    "To prevent data leakage when building a machine learning model, you can take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand the problem and the data: Before building a model, it is important to understand the problem you are trying to solve and the data you have. This includes identifying potential sources of leakage and ensuring that the data is properly labeled and cleaned.\n",
    "Split the data into training and test sets: Splitting the data into separate training and test sets ensures that the model is not trained on information that will be used to evaluate its performance. The test set should be kept completely separate from the training set until the final evaluation.\n",
    "Use cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique for estimating the performance of a model on new data by splitting the training data into multiple folds and evaluating the model on each fold. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to specific patterns in the training data.\n",
    "Be careful with feature selection: Feature selection should be done based on information that would be available at prediction time, not based on information from the test set or other sources of leakage.\n",
    "Use proper validation techniques: When tuning hyperparameters or selecting models, proper validation techniques such as nested cross-validation should be used to ensure that the final model is not biased by information from the test set or other sources of leakage.\n",
    "Monitor for leakage: Finally, it is important to monitor for potential sources of leakage throughout the modeling process and take corrective action if necessary. This includes reviewing feature importance rankings, examining model predictions, and testing the model on new data to ensure that it is generalizing well."
